**Short Bio:** I am a first year EEB PhD student in the Moyle Lab. As an undergraduate my research focused on computational estimation of plant mating system parameters with the ultimate goal of better understanding processes of island colonization and speciation. As a graduate student, I am interested in studying the genetic mechanisms of adaptation in wild tomato species. I want to integrate population genetics, genomics, and field studies to understand how plants adapt to changing environments. 

**Course Expectations:**   
* To learn the basics of using Git and Github to collaborate and contribute to open science   
* To understand basic measures of biodiversity and find ways to apply them to Solanum.   
* To learn basic phylogenetic methods   
* To become more familiar with R.
